# Electrons-as-the-universal-source-of-concious-communication
As electrons travel through nerves to create electrical impulses, electrons are also flowing through strands of DNA providing base 64 instructions from DNA codons. As two biological entities communicate, electrons are transported as symbols, light, sound and through scent. Charges on foreign molecues and base 64 codes in foreign DNA communicate messages between bodies. Within the body, electrons recieved are relayed to decision making areas of the body for analysis and the response from recieving body is broadcasted in ruturn to sender.
